# Ishmael on The Test Subject As a False Positive

I've been with the Peep-Odd for over a year now, and it's late December 2023. I've seen many - many - fellow researchers and professionals come and go. Those that stay are few but some are akin to myself, seeking to limit the damage and harm it does to the Subject and to Medicine in general should Dr. Harm succeed in his ambitions. Others are not research professionals but friends and families of the stakeholders, which has always been a bit weird, but Dr. Harm insisted on it as beneficial to our academic pursuit.

Watching an edited video of the Test Subject shot completely without the man's consent is the standard onboarding procedure for most research professionals joining the Peep-Odd. Due to the constraint of making this a Reality TV show, it's cut up with emojis and sound effects. Dr. Harm insists this is for the benefit of the project's budget, he calls it a "streamlining of resources."

At that point, most all researchers accept that the Test Subject shows signs of delusions, as they had been told upon joining. The video footage, while obviously edited for the widest audience to find humour in another human's mental illness, was clear of this: he displayed a grandiose dialogue, often carried conversations without anyone else in the room as though they were in the room, possibly hallucinating them, and had a grand theory of a cabal of people persecuting him.

The first few days go pretty easy for most. The accomodations have been superb. These usually slip away as so much background noise within the first few weeks, against the sheer horror of adapting to the idea of this being in anyway appropriate.

All researchers eventually watch the Test Subject live, for hours. He is compelling. It is research. There are superb accomodations. It's just a job.

At some point, typically within the first few weeks, it becomes clear to the researchers that the Test Subject is aware of the surveillance, such to question whether or not the Test Subject is indeed acting. For those of us that have stayed for more than three months, it is also quite clear that the Test Subject likes to talk directly to us, those surveilling him, and admit to lying about things he led us on to believe days, weeks, or months ago, just so we'd react. We often do, setting up paid actors and more to provide stimuli that the Test Subject has in fact primed us to set up for him.

It is incredibly clear that there is no way we can consider any of our test data valid given that the Test Subject is both aware of our presence in some form and has been actively telling us he's been lying on purpose to see if we'd react to validate our presence. Whose experiment is this anyway? To Dr. Harm the answer was always too clear to even ask the question, and he refused to participate in any of our debates as researchers on the potential invalidity of our approach. Also, he signed our paychecks.

It is not clear if the Test Subject knew early on that he was being evaluated psychiatrically. It is always a point of debate amongst the team. The Test Subject is now claiming to have known the entire time. I believe him.

For those who have left, the threat of having to confront this man with the truth, that he is under a psyhicatric experiment being conducted without his consent, combined with the idea of the initial prognosis being incorrect, seemed like a wide open avenue for something like medical malpractice being led on the part of Dr. Harm. The debates that typically lead to departures usually consider all the different routes that this would be seen as foul, and most leave after assessing the risk. Reality TV does not help this situation.

Why have I stayed? The Test Subject is a compelling man, for sure, but the situation has a vortex all to it's own. It is history. It is a train wreck. It is high drama. It is likely criminal. I must stay, I must see this to it's bitter end and hope for the most ethical of conclusions.

Besides, who likes skipping the end of a movie?
