# The Test Subject on The Test Subject As a False Positive

Fuck yeah I did this shit on purpose.

That said, did I ever think it would have kept going like it did? No, I did not.

Should I have stopped, or reversed course far earlier as it escalated? Yes, I probably should have.

This has been the deepest, most devestating regret in my life. I hope to live a long life after this is over, and I pray that it will continue to be the deepest, most devastating regret in my life until my dying breath.

I'm never gonna do this stupid shit again. Ever.

But for the time being - I just don't know how to stop.

I may have been a bit too excited to see that Shakespeare's Hamlet in the play _Hamlet_ did basically what I did when I was suspicious of being surveilled - I hadn't known the story until I watched the early 2000's film adaptation a few months ago this summer of 2023.

If I've learned one thing: no one should want to be a Shakespeare character. Just read the goddamn play, or see it in some form. Hamlet fucking dies at the end. I'm not trying to go out like that. But then again, I'm not in line for any thrones to the Kindom of Denmark either. You'd think otherwise based on what my parents feel they're capable of, but I digress.

Anyway it didn't take me long to figure out this was some psychiatric babble squat, and it took me less time after that to figure out what they were trying to diagnose me with. Given that making legal claims would be unlikely, I figure'd the best thing to do would be to give them what they wanted, get them to act on it, and eventually reveal that I was leading them on the whole time once they finally address me in person.

I looked up the criteria for delusional disorder pretty early on and got excited. Acting out delusions of persecution was easy; they were spying on me and I just had to comment on that.

Adding in gradiosity to that mix allowed me to elaborate the story to involve any character, person, corporation, or government entity I wanted, so long as I thought it was funny. Not being scared of my persecutors - which while truthful could still be conceived as provided by my delusion of gradiosity - just made the whole thing more comedic for me.

Eventually, after the first year, I got around to delusions of erotomania and jealousy. Those took me awhile - I do have some negative self esteem issues and I had to wait for inspiration there.

Why was grandiosity easier to get to immediately, and my favorite of all delusions to portray? I think it was all the braggadocio from rappers I've taken in over the years. 50 Cent has a line where he says he's "the greatest - somethin' like [Muhammad] Ali in his prime." What the fuck does that even mean? Curtis Jackson got shot in the face before he became a rapper named 50 Cent. Cassius Clay punched other people in their face before and after he became a Muslim named Muhammad Ali. How are the two even related? Well, I guess I'm not a rapper and I'm just a Test Subject to an experiment which I thought would be a good starting ground to make sure better standards were achieved in Medicine in the future, without all that busy work involved with normative issue advocacy. My civics are inspired by early aughts club rap. What, you're so cultured?

I thought if they figure'd out I was doing this - even a slim chance of it - they themselves would have a debate and wonder about the likelihood of this being Medical Malpractice, something I knew I could make an argument for based on my actual, consented therapy and knowledge of my own symptoms and personal backstory in truth, and not the fiction I was making up to get those surveilling on me to feel like they could admit to such a thing.

I mean, I thought they'd figure that out and just leave me alone. Why risk medical malpractice coming up in such a way where your colleagues would have to feel like the Test Subject planned it all along?

You're goddamn right I did this shit on purpose.

What did the doctors think when I kept saying I was "entraptertaining" them? I'm guessing some of them got it, but what do I know - I'm just making up a fiction as far as I'm concerned.

The fuck am I, some kind of George Orwell reading _The War of the Worlds_ on a radio broadcast where the audience actually believes what I'm saying?

That said, I never thought they'd keep this up for over a few months, but now we're getting close to two years.

So did I do this shit on purpose? Yes, yes I did. Do I regret it? Yes, yes I do.
