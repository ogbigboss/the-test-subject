# Dr. A. Harm on The Test Subject As a False Positive

There is no way the Test Subject knew they were under a psychiatric experiment the entire time. They are simply rationalizing after the fact of realizing such a thing.

No, even if they realize it later on it does not invalidate my data from beforehand.

My data. Is not. Invalid!

I just have to prove it, is all. Until then I will pay no heed to the naysayers. As the leader of an empirical study it is my sensory experience which matters above and beyond anyone else's - I will be the decider of validity of sense, and to do so I must rise above the noise of such common interloping censors.
