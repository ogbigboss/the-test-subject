# The Two Spies and the Journalist

"So do you do this kind of thing often?"

"Not really. It's kind of upside down. Normally I'm hired to figure out who is worth poaching - younger up and comers that are prime performers for their companies - my clients typically want to figure out who's worth stealing from another company. This guy kind of embarassed the people who tried to make a Reality TV show to embarass him. Honestly I'm not sure what my clients stand to gain from all this, but they keep paying me. What about you?"

"What about me?"

"Do you do this kind of thing often?"

"Well, in my line of work I get all kinds of emails and I try and look into every one. Now everyone in the media's been getting these emails with links to the surveillance footage of the guy, first in his apartment then in his parent's home in New Jersey. It's funny but it's creepy."

"Yeah, even I think that's creepy. If the guy wasn't such a human car crash it'd be hard to watch."

"Oh, let's give him credit - he's also very funny. But no, I can't say it's normal for me save for the story itself. Is it worth reporting on? Probably, but then our bosses would fire us. It's fun as far as gossip goes. Normally a story like this would be guarded, kept secret so only one of us could get the byline. Now it's an excuse to meet our favorite artists. How about you, Mr. Military man?"

"Hrrm, ex military man. Embarassing an important foreign national during an important gathering to gain a wedge somehow? Sure, maybe, that'd be normal. But this guy is... well he's just some guy. I'm not sure why the story didn't end with him getting fired and his bosses moving on. I think it has something to do with the Hollywood exposure of Reality TV."

"So what's the military's interest in all this?"

"Well, we - hrrm, they - want to keep tabs on the networks of connections created by this one man. The actors, the corporate executives, the foreign spy agencies, the rock stars, the politicians, and yes, even the corporate spies."

"I feel kind of honored."

"Don't - you're just another of the hundreds of people that aren't supposed to know about this."
