# Ishmael on Non Consenual Dreams

The move to North New Jersey, the test subject's childhood home, created some stop gaps in scientific procedure.

The Reality TV folks had already setup the speaker system in the Test Subject's bedroom before any of us could provide reasonable objections, and were having fun with it given the speaker was connected to the internet and anyone with the web address could now narrate the Test Subject's dreams.

Whenever we would bring up complaints in the name of science, Dr. Harm would triangulate by finding a way to include the Reality TV stakeholders in the conversation. Things would usually start with a reminder of how "funny it will be" to tell the Test Subject they nicknamed Dr. Harm _Doctor Sleep_, one of the Test Subject's favorite movies, but only after the Test Subject "finally cracks up." Dr. Harm would leave that last line to the Reality TV folks, but would chuckle in allegiance.

Ignoring the irony of _Doctor Sleep_'s central character using their childhood traumas against the evil people trying to steal his shine, I or one of the other researchers would push for academic arguments.

Either Dr. Harm or the Reality TV stakeholders would vaguely reference Sigmund Freud's debunked theories on dreams, framing it as a continuation of science while keeping the theory's lack of empirical evidence outside of said frame. Eventually, the conversation would devolve in references to the movie _Inception_, at which point we would give up.
