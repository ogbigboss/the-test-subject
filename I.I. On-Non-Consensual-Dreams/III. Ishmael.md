# Ishmael on Non Consenual Dreams

The move to North New Jersey, the test subject's childhood home, created some stop gaps in scientific procedure.

The Reality TV folks had already setup the speaker system in the Test Subject's bedroom before any of us could provide reasonable objections, and were having fun with it given the speaker was connected to the internet and anyone with the web address could now narrate the Test Subject's dreams.

Whenever we would bring up complaints in the name of science, Dr. Harm would find a way to include the Reality TV stakeholders in the conversation, and it would always end up in references to the movie _Inception._
