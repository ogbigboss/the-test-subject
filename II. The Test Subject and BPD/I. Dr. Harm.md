# Dr. A. Harm on the Test Subject and BPD

NOTES: Dr. Harm should feel that BPD doesn't exist, and is dismayed by the opinions of those he feels not worthy to be a part of this experiment, but have been allowed to by the contamination of the Test Subject's choices as well as Reality TV (the latter which cannot be blamed, the former which msut be). Dr. Harm should admit that BPD can be tested, but only if all experiments also involve a test for delusional disorder. Dr. Harm should justify the lack of isolation as crucial to the funding / original experiment, and by ways of his leadership.
