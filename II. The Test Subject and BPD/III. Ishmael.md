# Ishmael on the Test Subject and BPD

NOTES: Al should end his section here underlining the Test Subject's growing need for attention by acting out alongside their awareness of the surveillance and utilizing the surveillance and the internet (allude to something like a shared video folder) to gain attention to the experiment (make first allusions to this being known to some kind of outer sphere of people). Also have Al give a quick nod or two to Reality TV and the fact that people act out there rather than be their true selves, also mention Tim Cook saying people act differently under surveillance and have Al ponder about Cook's awareness to this experiment given the timings, be vague
