# The Test Subejct on Medical Ethics and Malpractice

So Amathia is this Greek word Socrates came up with, right? It's kinda like being a smart dumb motherfucker, in some ways.

The story goes like this - one of his students asks Socrates why, despite that student having a bunch of reputable education and all that, why does the student not have any success in Politics? Encroaching Roman Empire aside, Socrates told the student that he had intelligence but lacked wisdom, and called that Amathia.

Given the Grecian Empire fell - though I guess after Socrates' time - and this student of Socrates' was in politics, I'm guessing we can also blame the empire falling on that Amathia thing being more popular than not at some point in Greece.

Also given that the Greeks recorded things with stone masonry, maybe they couldn't write the whole thing down. I've read before it's the opposite of Sophia, or wisdom. I've met a psychic, a stripper, and a delivery person named Sophia in recent times. What's the opposite of that?

In my opinion, Amathia is not having success at something though you have a lot of education and pedigree or whatever, and not getting why.

Would dumb smart motherfucker work better there?

Anyway, I think my personal Amathia in this situation has been that while I at all times have earned a world class reputation in "talking shit" - I was not wise at all to think that the only way out was through, that method at least. I've honestly not gotten why.

Recently I've been thinking it has something to do with that wise mind stuff I was just getting into, or maybe this BPD splitting thing I've read about.

I mean, I read about it a few years ago too. And I read about it, but only briefly, near the start of this shenanigan as well.

So did I know this was medical malpractice? That's goddamn right - Hell yeah I did.

I mean, not like a lawyer or anything, but I figure'd yeah, this whole shindig was no good.

But I still didn't call it out for that possibility, at least in spirit if not legally, until over a year later. I'm gonna be thinking about why I didn't for a long time. I'm thinking I'm one of those dumb-assed smart dumb motherfuckers Socrates was teaching.

I wish I had read a bit more about BPD when this started, but I had my reasons for keeping it light, considering I knew what the Doctor behind the camera was up to. I'm pretty sure he's only making it worse hoping it turns into something he can make for better TV. I try to give him what he wants, but it takes a lot sometimes - I'm a computer programmer, "talking shit" was just kind of a hobby before all this. I could've taken an earlier turn but for some reason I kept roping them further in.

Maybe I liked the attention. It was self destructive though, that's for sure.

I can move on, one day. This shit shall pass - sorry, bad joke.

First, I gotta get through whatever this is. But after this, I gotta get into therapy to make sure I never do this stupid shit again.

Or, that even if I do, I end it a lot sooner.

Sometimes growth is easier in small steps.
