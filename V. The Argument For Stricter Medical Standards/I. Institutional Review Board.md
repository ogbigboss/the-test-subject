# Institutional Review Board's Statement

NOTES: An IRB should be revealed at this point, defined, and should resoundingly reject the "research" as foul. The points should be that it blantantly ignored all medical ethics standards around confidentiality, destroyed the Test Subject's employability, and end in proclaiming the measures as blatant medical malpractice given that the potentials and relevant research around borderline personality disorder were ignored by Dr. Harm. The reader should be setup to feel all is right with authority as it exists - that it will correct it's own misdeeds, that society in fact works. That should be undone in the next section, particularly Dr. Harm's Epilogue. A false catharsis leading to a doomed denoument in the next section.
