# The Test Subject on The Argument For Stricter Medical Standards

So my parents brought me to Red Lobster for my birthday. This used to be a family tradition. If my mom were any other kind of doctor than a neurologist, she may have chosen another family tradition. Say what you will about the chain, I never minded it before.

Before the hostess seated us I saw them take a C note from someone at the bar, and then they brought us to the back where there was one table in the corner booth and no one else in sight. My dad noted how we could see our car from here - I thought it was rude to imply this was a rough section of highway, but held all my thoughts to myself.

The meal went fine. We shared the fondue as an appetizer. Something about Red Lobster makes me more tolerant of lactose.

Near the end of the meal, my mother brings it up, but not before ordering a suspicious fresh basket of Cheddar Bay Biscuits. Before the entree, sure, but before dessert?

Yes she tells me, there was a psychological experiment, and that it's over now, and I don't need to worry about it.

I tell her I'd like to know some details, like what happened, for how long, and most importantly -

My mom then cuts me off at the "I" word by non consensually stuffing my mouth with a Cheddar Bay Biscuit. My liberal sensibilities kick in and I take the extra lactose with the bread.

This goes back and forth for a few biscuits, after which my mother spares the energy of reaching across the table and begins throwing the biscuits at me, at which point I just change the subject.

I then tell my mom about this short story I read where an evil doctor was doing experiments on a family's estranged son, until the son protects himself using the ethics of the medical profession and sues for medical malpractice, which brings the son's family back together, and everyone was happy and no one blamed anyone in the family but the evil doctor.

My mother immediately responds: "Poor Doctor." The waiter, alarmed by the biscuits on the floor, comes by and my mom cuts him off before he can say anything -

"Dessert, please!"


### Notes to self (the author)

It might be more realistic to have us seated in an area where multiple parties are obviously watching us, some gossiping loudly with their eyes, some with their hands covered over their mouths, some with shotgun mics loosely hidden under unused napkins and drink menus. The "moment of honesty" / biscuit interruption thing would probably happen back home, but maybe I can avoid the whole Red Lobster scene this birthday.
