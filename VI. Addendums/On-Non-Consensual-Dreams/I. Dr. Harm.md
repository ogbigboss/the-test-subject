# Dr. A. Harm on Non Consenual Dreams

"To sleep, perchance to dream" - therefore, if a test subject who likens themselves to Hamlet falls asleep, they've given us consent to _join_ their dreams, not _force_ them to have dreams against a free will that can't be qualified while they are asleep!

(Note to self: double check the above with the lawyers.)

At any rate, our placing an audio speaker in a vent above the Test Subject's bed helped us make leaps in our scientific research.

Leaps! In Science! One small dream for the Test Subject against the idea of their free will, a leap for mankind in understanding their dreams! That we did this in the Test Subject's childhood home, in a town where he shares an origin with Buzz Aldrin, is of no coincidence at all.

This is of great scientific achievement, and is not - NOT - an attempt to piggyback off of the research on lucid dreams published in early 2021 to much television accord, and is NOT the idea of the Reality TV stakeholders on the project, though their opinion is of great weight to me.

That one man will forever not trust their own dreams due to this "consent" issue is of pathetic non consequence to the validation of our project in a way that could build on the science of others - I am not trying to just "get some TV interview time on CNN", I am trying to stand on the shoulders of giants! Giants!

This! Is! For! Science!
