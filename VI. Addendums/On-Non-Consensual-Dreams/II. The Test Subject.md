# The Test Subject on Non Consensual Dreams

So I've been a regular marijuana smoker and caffeine abuser for some time now. I like the stuff, mostly, though yeah I could probably do both less, especially the marijuana.

That said, I've gotten used to it.

Over the past decade plus, one thing I've always been able to rely on is if I smoke or drink just enough a few hours before going to sleep, I'm guaranteed to not have any dreams I can remember.

It takes 9 hours to feel fully refreshed, as opposed to 6, but it's not so bad. Otherwise I have a few recurring nightmares and a handful of random dreams, particularly when I take a break or a vacation of some sort which limits my ingestion of marijuana or caffeine for one reason or another. Which ain't so bad.

So, when I came back to my childhood home, fully aware my parents have signed me away to some psychological experiment that led me back to my childhood home in the first place, I wasn't too surprised that all of a sudden, I started having dreams again, despite regulating my marijuana and caffeine intake.

Unlike my apartment in the city where the psychological experiment began as per the consent of my landlord, there's a vent right above my head where I sleep. It wasn't too hard to figure out why the dreams were happening.

The other big clue? It always felt like someone was narrating them. Like, I'd both hear and feel shit like a change in scene starting with the phrase "and then..." My authentic dreams feel like, well, dreams. Like I'm experiencing them as opposed to being told what's happening.

Furthermore, the dreams themselves were fucking stupid as fuck. I could tell whoever was doing it, at least between August and November of 2023, was just having fun and trying to get me to freak out about this or that, treating it like some college prank.

However, starting in November, but punctuated after December 9th 2023, the dreams felt like someone was trying to prove that they could "trigger" certain reactions to the dreams, almost as though some scientist had to prove that they were actually doing science and not just allowing their non scientist friends to play pranks behind an excuse of science.

My biggest argument against this being scientific, of course, is that I don't fucking tell you people every dream I'm suspicious of. How's your data look now? Like a bunch of fucking swiss cheese, holed up as fuck, that's what. You think I'm not reacting or that you've proven something isn't important, but really, your data is fucked because I'm not telling you how stupid I think you are for involving the dumb shit you put into my dreams.

I've never dreamed of celebrities once in my adult life. Given what you've made those people do via your narration in my head, I think you oughta check with them about the scripts first, I doubt they'd even consent to it, and they don't have to live through the experience of your bullshit ass fake fantasy.

Why have I held back? Because some of these things are awkward as fuck. Not my thoughts - but your thoughts. I wouldn't think this shit. My dreams are far more figurative then this bullshit. That said, my silence on your antics allows insight into what the experimenters think is important or want to achieve, and I can actively work against that by denying them importance in things they are suggesting via dreams that are all too easy to remember because I'm not actually dreaming, I'm trying to sleep while you're running audio above my head.

It's made my sleep worse, for whatever it's worth. Refreshed, I do not feel.

I ended up buying ear plugs. I use the ear plugs, I don't have any dreams. That said, now I always have an itch in my ear. Will it lead to an infection? Will I sue for harm based on an ear infection that I only have due to a bunch of idiots forcing me to have dreams for fun in an excuse of science, like a bunch of neighborhood kids who took a set of walkie talkies too far?

At least I have the knowledge that my actual dreams are way cooler than the lame ones these idiots come up for me. Do lab rats feel the same way about their exercise wheels vs. running in the wild?
