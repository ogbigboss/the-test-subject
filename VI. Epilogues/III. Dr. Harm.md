# Dr. Harm's Epilogue

NOTE: Dr. Harm should do the same, forcing the reader to question what actually happened without technically invalidating either Ishmael or the Test Subject's point of view on conclusions. Dr. Harm is grateful that the experiment is allowed to continue, though it's goals - and Test Subjects - have changed. The funders of the experiment seek to find a way to continue to treat the lesser thans - Ishmaels, Test Subjects, and to an extent and by his own admission Dr. Harms - as nothign more than a societal petri dish.

The reader should see that if this is possible, it should be equally possible that both Ishmael and the Test Subject were telling the truth, but that they were deceived.

Dr. Harm should somewhat openly and brazenly reveal the "point" of the story as this: the "leadership class", when drowned by the contagion of Amathia (Socrates defined this as roughly equating to a lack of wisdom amidst valid intelligence), strays away from from seeking to achieve in society and seeks instead to deceive society. Proverbially landing on the moon is no longer the goal of the leadership class, so much as faking such a thing and being lauded for it anyway is.

Dr. Harm's work is such to ensure that the leadership class will never have to face their own Amathia by ensuring that they can redefine the fabric of society before being called out via the same deceit that allows for Amathia in the first place. The Dr. Harms of the world and their false research experiments allow for this to extend pass a lack of self reflection to reveal the experiment's purpose to be creating a set of standard approaches around distorting the reflection of society's self: Trumpian "fake news", if not "fake Reality (TV)", but as a matter of science.

That was the entire goal of this whole experiment in the first place.
