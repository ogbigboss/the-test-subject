Within a shockingly embarrassing and short time frame after the epilogues, the Test Subject is alerted to the "phoney baloney research" that happened and given all kinds of documents verifying it's existence. This occurs because a completely separate spat happens between several of the people involved and / or aware of the Test Subject's situation and they wanted some kind of revenge for the completely separate incident, so they figure the best way would be to let the Test Subject know what happened so they can take appropriate legal action.

The court is horrified at the decision by Dr. A Harm to hide behind the Test Subject's parents' trip to India as an excuse as to why they did not alert the Test Subject sooner to the research as per basic standard medical ethics, and were even more so aggravated by the length of time between the tests' dismissal and the date of the initial lawsuit filing in question.

Another thing which particularly aggravated the court was the decision by Dr. A Harm's financial backers to seek a second opinion on the test subject after the IRB's dismissal. This apparently put so much pressure on the Test Subject's father that he began to express depressed, suicidal thoughts, saying he didn't want to live anymore after hearing his son sing, of all things. Furthermore, Dr. A Harm's financial backers sought a Presidential waver on political grounds that the Test Subject's matador like rantings tricked them into; while diversity is a valiant cause, **racial politics should never be the motivation behind medical research, and particularly the motivation behind not seeking informed consent.**

Thinking of the Hippocratic oath, Phrenology, the Nuremberg code, and the Tuskegee experiments, the court felt it must act to preserve modernity itself against the forces behind Dr. A Harm.

But mostly, the court was aghast at the overall truth that the research was hidden from the Test Subject the whole time, showing a blatant disregard for our modern medical society's approach to ethics. This unethical hiding of the truth easily ratifies the Test Subject's case against Dr. A Harm. The Test Subject's ruined career, psyche, and compassion for the poor taste of others is compensated for and they live happily ever after.

...

During the trial, aliens invade the planet Earth. Because of the trial's televised nature, literally no humans try to stop the aliens as the trial seems to ratify that maybe humanity shouldn't be in charge of itself. Also these aliens seem much more proficient at handling bureaucracy justly, as they demonstrate with their "zero casualties via causalities" take over of humanity.

The Aliens are impressed by the Test Subject's ability to entangle and entrance such a thick portion of the bureaucracy they are taking over in order to help calm the calamity that was formerly known as Human life. Thus, the aliens announce the Test Subject as the Supreme Leader of Humanity, which is largely just a nodding head, 1-2 meetings a fiscal quarter style job given how much better the Aliens are at handling society than us humans. Although the meeting notes read as though they were distracted at times, the Test Subject lives happily ever after.

...

When questioned why the Aliens trust the Test Subject with impunity, they respond by saying only he knows the true worth of the human race: to be a muse-ing. ~~Muse taxes are instituted retroactively by the Aliens, with heavy deductions for those that provided receipts proving their financial support for the Test Subject's counter opportunism operation opportunity.~~ As no one ever brings up any of this ever again, the Test Subject lives happily forever after.
